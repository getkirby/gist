# Kirby Gist

Github does not support Gists for organisations. This is our replacement. We collect all sorts of code snippets and examples here. Mostly for internal use, but maybe they are helpful for some of you as well. 

Each code example lives in its own file. We sort them into folders by language (php, css, html, js, vue, etc.)
